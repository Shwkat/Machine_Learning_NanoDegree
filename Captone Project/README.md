# Starbucks Capstone Project
Starbucks â€˜goal is to give their customers best service, so Starbucks provide an app for customers to make online purchases in willing to increase sales and customers satisfaction. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free).
This project aims to find the best offer to be send to the customer by predicting if the customer will complete the offer or not.
